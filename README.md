#### Cargo Dynamic Ship Modelling
In order to study the dynamic behavior of ships navigating in severe environmental conditions it is imperative to develop their governing equations of motion taking into account the inherent nonlinearity of large-amplitude ship motion. The purpose of this project is to present the coupled result of nonlinear equations of motion in heave, roll, and pitch based on physical past data of ship in various weather and wave conditions gathered over time, which is further compiled with live weather and wave direction data to predict current pitch and roll without any needs of live sensors.
